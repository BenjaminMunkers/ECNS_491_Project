# ECNS_491_Project
Our project will look for a relationship between weather and the economy. We want to see if there is a correlation between poor or good
weather in financial centers in the United States and the overall economy. To do this we will use historical data from the past 2 years on
weather and stock prices taken from the Dow Jones and the NASDAQ. The main centers we will look at will be New York City, and Chicago
with the possibility to look at a few other cities that may be relavent to the stock market. This study can be used to help predict what
might happen to the stock market if there is poor weather in the major financial centers in the United States. Our data for the NASDAQ 
comes from yahoo finance (https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EIXIC?p=%5EIXIC) while our data for the Dow Jones comes from their hosted
website(https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/dow-jones-industrial-average/#overview). The data for the weather is taken from
visual crossing as they offer free data on weather in a variety of city but limit the amount of data that can be taken from their cite at
one time(https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather/weather-data-services). Since weather data is often secured behind a pay wall, this cite
was the closes thing we could find to free and publicly available.
